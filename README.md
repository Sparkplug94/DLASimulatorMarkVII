Simple Particle Tracking Code for DLA

CURRENT ISSUES: Outlier particles and complex numbers - currently, some particles appear to get imaginary kicks. i.e. a momentum kick from a DLA that is not a real number. I have no idea why, but i suspect this is the source of the "outlier" particles, with energies waaaay outside the norm. Trying to fix this problem currently
